## Info about PA2

Dear Mary and TA,

If you have installed GNU Make, then you can use my `makefile` to simplify your work.

* `make --file=my_makefile`: You can compile all the Java code to AVR Assembly and run them with MJSIM.jar at one time.

* `make --file=my_makefile clean`: you can remove all the generated files (.s).

I hope it can reduce your work :)
