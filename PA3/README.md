### Problem

1. No Symbol Table, which means there is no way to know the size of the variable (e.g. byte or int?), thus I can only assume that all the int constant to be the type of int, regardless of `(byte)1` or `1`. I will fix this problem (for operators like `+/-/*`) when I start to implement the Symbol Table.
