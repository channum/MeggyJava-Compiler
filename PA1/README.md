## Info about PA1

Dear Mary and TA,

If you have installed GNU Make, then you can use my `makefile` to simplify your work.

* `make` or `make dot`: Just simply run `make` under the folder `PA1/`, you shall be able to compile all the test cases from PA2 to PA5 into `dot` files at one time.

* `make run`: If you run `make run` under the folder `PA1/`, you shall be able to compile all the test cases from PA2 to PA5 into `class` files and run them at one time.

* `make clean`: you can use `make clean` to remove all the generated files (.dot and .class).

I hope it can reduce your work :)
